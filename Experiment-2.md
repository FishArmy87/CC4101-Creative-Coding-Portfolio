thsi is my second experiment 
a landscape generator of buldings and trees
[Here](/buildings/index.html)

In this experiment i could of down better by using a class to create each of the biulds to make it so each building could be made of different heights each time and different widths even with different amounts of doors or windows 
i believe i could expand the amount of other details as well for exaple the trees i could have different kinds or other detilas like light poles abeaches or other simple details
