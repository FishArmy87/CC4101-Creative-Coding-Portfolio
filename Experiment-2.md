thsi is my second experiment 
a landscape generator of buldings and trees
[Here](/buildings/index.html)

In htis experiment i could of down better by using a class to create each of the biulds to make it so eac hbuilding could be made of different hieghts each time and differnt widths even wioth different amounts of door s or windows 
i deleve i could expand the amount of other details as well for exaple the trees i could have different kinds or other detilas like light poles abeaches or other simple details
